## Prompts Used During Development

The following types of prompts were used during development to guide implementation and debugging.

### Architecture & Implementation
- How to build a document question-answering app using LangChain?
- How to implement document embeddings and vector search?
- How to structure a Streamlit web application?
- How to integrate FAISS vector database?

### Debugging & Error Fixes
- Fix circular import error in Python project
- Resolve FAISS vector store loading errors
- Fix embedding initialization errors
- Solve dependency and environment setup issues
- Fix Streamlit deployment issues

### Improvements & Optimization
- Improve document chunking strategy
- Improve question-answer retrieval flow
- Optimize Streamlit UI layout
- Improve code organization and readability

### Deployment Support
- Steps to deploy Streamlit app
- Fix deployment environment errors
- Prepare GitHub repository for submission

## Note
Prompts were used mainly for debugging, architecture guidance, and improving implementation. All code was reviewed and tested manually before submission.
