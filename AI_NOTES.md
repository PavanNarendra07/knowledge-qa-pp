## AI Usage in This Project

AI tools were used to assist in development, debugging, and improving implementation quality during this project.

## Areas Where AI Helped
AI assistance was used for:

- Understanding LangChain document processing workflow
- Fixing coding and dependency errors
- Handling vector store and embedding integration
- Improving Streamlit UI structure
- Resolving deployment and environment issues
- Improving code readability and structure

## Manual Verification
All AI-generated suggestions were manually reviewed, tested, and modified where necessary to ensure correctness and understanding.

The final implementation was validated by running the application locally and verifying all functionalities.

## LLM and Embeddings Used
- Embeddings: HuggingFace Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Vector Store: FAISS
- Frontend: Streamlit

Free/local models were used to avoid API dependency and ensure reliable execution.

## Understanding Commitment
All submitted code is understood by the developer, and modifications were made personally during debugging and testing phases.
